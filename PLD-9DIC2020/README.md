* [231 0x00. Python - Hello, World](https://intranet.hbtn.io/projects/231)
* [233 0x01. Python - if/else, loops, functions](https://intranet.hbtn.io/projects/233)

## Exercises
#### 1. Write a Python program to find those numbers which are divisible by 7 and multiple of 5, between 1500 and 2700 (both included). 

#### 2. Write a Python program to convert temperatures to and from celsius, fahrenheit. 
[ Formula : ```c/5 = f-32/9``` [ where c = temperature in celsius and f = temperature in fahrenheit ]

**Expected Output:**
```
60°C is 140 in Fahrenheit
45°F is 7 in Celsius
```

#### 3. Write a Python program to guess a number between 1 to 9. 
**Note:** User is prompted to enter a guess. If the user guesses wrong then the prompt appears again until the guess is correct, on successful guess, user will get a "Well guessed!" message, and the program will exit.

#### 4. Write a Python program to construct the following pattern, using a nested for loop.

```bash
* 
* * 
* * * 
* * * * 
* * * * * 
* * * * 
* * *

```

#### 5. Write a Python program that accepts a word from the user and reverse it. 

#### 6. Write a Python program that prints all the numbers from 0 to 6 except 3 and 6.
**Note:** Use ```continue``` statement.
**Expected Output:**
```
0 1 2 4 5
```

#### 7. Write a Python program to get the Fibonacci series between 0 to 50. 
**Note:** The Fibonacci Sequence is the series of numbers: ```0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, ....```
Every next number is found by adding up the two numbers before it.
**Expected Output:** 
```
1 1 2 3 5 8 13 21 34
```

#### 8. Write a Python program which iterates the integers from 1 to 50. For multiples of three print "Fizz" instead of the number and for the multiples of five print "Buzz". For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print "FizzBuzz".
**Sample Output:**
```
fizzbuzz
1
2
fizz
4
buzz
```

#### 9. Write a Python program that accepts a string and calculate the number of digits and letters. 
Sample Data: ```Python 3.2```
**Expected Output:**
```
Letters 6
Digits 2
```

#### 10. Write a Python program to check the validity of password input by users. 
Validation:

* At least 1 letter between [a-z] and 1 letter between [A-Z].
* At least 1 number between [0-9].
* At least 1 character from [$#@].
* Minimum length 6 characters.
* Maximum length 16 characters.

#### 11. Write a Python program to calculate a dog's age in dog's years. 
Note: For the first two years, a dog year is equal to 10.5 human years. After that, each dog year equals 4 human years.
**Expected Output:**
```
Input a dog's age in human years: 15                                    
The dog's age in dog's years is 73
```

#### 12. Write a Python program to check whether an alphabet is a vowel or consonant. 
**Expected Output:**
```
Input a letter of the alphabet: k                                       
k is a consonant.
```

#### 13. Write a Python program to convert month name to a number of days. 
**Expected Output:**
```
List of months: January, February, March, April, May, June, July, August
, September, October, November, December                                
Input the name of Month: February                                       
No. of days: 28/29 days 
```

#### 14. Write a Python program to sum of two given integers. However, if the sum is between 15 to 20 it will return 20. 

#### 15. Write a Python program to find the median of three values. 
**Expected Output:**
```
Input first number: 15                                                  
Input second number: 26                                                 
Input third number: 29
