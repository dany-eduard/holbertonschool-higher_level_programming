# 0x07. Python - Test-driven development

The [doctest](https://docs.python.org/3.4/library/doctest.html#module-doctest) module searches for pieces of text that look like interactive Python sessions, and then executes those sessions to verify that they work exactly as shown. There are several common ways to use doctest:

- To check that a module’s docstrings are up-to-date by verifying that all interactive examples still work as documented.
- To perform regression testing by verifying that interactive examples from a test file or a test object work as expected.
- To write tutorial documentation for a package, liberally illustrated with input-output examples. Depending on whether the examples or the expository text are emphasized, this has the flavor of “literate testing” or “executable documentation”.

## Requirements

### Python Scripts

- All your files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS using `python3` (version 3.4.3)
- All your files should end with a new line
- The first line of all your files should be exactly `#!/usr/bin/python3`
- Your code should use the `PEP 8` style (version `1.7.*`)
- All your files must be executable
- The length of your files will be tested using wc

### Python Test Cases

- All your files should end with a new line
- All your test files should be inside a folder `tests`
- All your test files should be text files (extension: `.txt`)
- All your tests should be executed by using this command: `python3 -m doctest ./tests/*`
- All your modules should have a documentation (`python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").__doc__)'`)
- All your functions should have a documentation (`python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").my_function.__doc__)'`)
- A documentation is not a simple word, it’s a real sentence explaining what’s the purpose of the module, class or method (the length of it will be verified)
- We strongly encourage you to work together on test cases, so that you don’t miss any edge case
